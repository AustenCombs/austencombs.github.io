									<p>University Connect is a location based global chatroom application that provides a way to safely connect with fellow campus neighbors. As it stands, with COVID-19, students are not allowed to have visitors over their apartments, whether family or friends. Community is a huge part of the college experience. The on-campus apartment areas provide one of the biggest avenues for meeting and connecting with new people. Due to the safety and health restrictions, students are less inclined to be outside.</p>
									<p>The application features personal accounts for students to create, and use, to sign-in to the application. Students are required to register with a valid university email to join their specific university-based channel. Upon registration, they will be sent a unique verification in order to validate their university status. Students can choose to update their account with personal information such as: major, age, graduation year, current year of study, picture, etc...</p>
									<p>The application will utilize GPS location, thereby needing permission to access mobile device location service, to display global chats within the area. The global chat rooms will be tied to specific locations on the university’s campus. As students enter into the room’s 250ft radius, the location specific chat rooms will become visible on the user’s device. Students will be alerted that the chats will disappear after being out of the radius for a minimum of 30 minutes. This feature can be altered at the user’s discretion. Students will have the option to favorite certain chats to keep them permanently viewable on the application’s home screen. Global chats will filter out profane and explicit content to keep things family friendly and Safe-for-Work appropriate.</p>
